# Studentist 

Studentist is a mobile application which connects people from Romania with students from dental Universities. 
Students from Romania are allowed in some universities to work on patients. Studentist connects people with dental problems with students from dental universities who are allowed to work on patients. 

The app supports two types of users: Patients and Studentists

Studentist is available in 7 cities from Romania: Timisoara, Bucuresti, Cluj, Iasi, Targu Mures, Sibiu, Craiova

Patients can make a request based on 4 categories: Pain, Dental Cleaning, Dental Cavities, Dental Prosthesis. 
Once the patient made a request, all the students from the same city as the patient will receive a notification that a new request was added. The early bird catches the worm, so only the first student will be able to take the request and contact the patient. The application will provide the phone number of the patient to the students and vice versa.
